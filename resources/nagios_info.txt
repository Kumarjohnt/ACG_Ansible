## For the sake of the exercise, you only need to install nrpe and
## add a local host entry for "nagios.exmaple.com" pointing to the
## specficied IP.  There is no need to do any further nagios configuration.

## Install the nrpe package "nrpe.x86_64" in the baseline role.
## You will find it in the EPEL repo which has been configured for you.

## The nagios Server IP should be set in the host file as follows:
10.128.83.44 kube-poc-uworker1
10.128.83.45 kube-poc-uworker2
